# TOPSIS Web Service

A full-stack web application that implements the **TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution)** method for solving **Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM)** problems.

The application allows users to upload a CSV file, validates inputs, computes TOPSIS scores and ranks, displays results instantly on the same page, enables downloading the output file, and optionally sends the result to the user via email.
